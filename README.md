# Overview of DeepCellLineage
The 'overview' repo will hold a general description of the DeepCellLineage group's goal, methods, projects, maintainers, contributors, communication channels, key concepts, FAQs, etc. Please see the Wiki for more details. 

## What is DeepCellLineage?
DeepCellLineage is a group of people who are teaching themselves bioinformatics and deep learning by doing projects related to cell biology. 

## Goal
The goal of DeepCellLineage is to find characteristics of cells that may relate to development or progression of cancer, autoimmune, or neurological diseases.

## Methods
1.  Use published bioinformatic methods to label scientific data
2.  Build deep learning models to gain more complex insights into biological interactions (these repo will have the prefix 'dp')

## Projects

### [mitolin](https://github.com/deepcelllineage/mitolin)

- Aim
  - Use standard bioinformatic methods to perform single cell lineage tracing using mitochondrial sequences


### [dpmitolin](https://github.com/deepcelllineage/dpmitolin)

- Aim
    - Use mitochondrial distance labels generated by mitolin as the ground truth to develop a deep learning heirarchical relationship model of single cells 

## Collaborators

- Cancer researchers [Assistant Professor Devon Lawson](http://lawsonlab.org) and [Assistant Professor Kai Kessenbrock](http://kessenbrocklab.com/), who are in the School of Medicine at UC Irvine
- The [Wicklow AI in Medicine Research Initiative (WAMRI)](https://wamri.ai/), launched by USF in 2018
